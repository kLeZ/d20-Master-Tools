	<string name="help_throwdice">To write a dice expression you have to write in the text input field something like below examples:
1D6
12D10-3
4D8+2

The expression evaluator accepts the following rules to verify a well written expression:
1. The expression should start with a digit
2. The expression can contain one and only one \'D\' token that divides the number of dice to roll with the die typology (Ex: D6, D8, D10)
3. The expression can contain a modifier against the dice to roll in the form of [dice][operator][digit] (Ex: 1D6+5, 4D10-9, 3D8*2)
4. The accepted operators are the arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/) in order to make possible the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division operations
5. The expression can contain one and only one operator at the same time, no other operators can be accepted writing the expression
6. The expression can contain every number of every digit even a weird expression like \'10000D57*32\', you are not limited with a list of dice you can roll such a 7-dice classic set roll possibility

One expression is written you have to evaluate it and it will appear under the \'Evaluate\' button.
If you want to add other expressions you should add an arithmetic operator to the evaluated expression by long clicking the expression and selecting the operator in the window just appeared.
Every expression you want to add needs an operator but, by default, the implicit operator is Addition if you do not specify one.

When your dice expression is completed you can tap the \'Roll\' button and see your result under that button.
You can roll many times the same expression unless you reset the expression view by selecting this action in the menu.
You can clear the results view by selecting the proper action in the menu.</string>
